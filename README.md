- 🎯 **Simple UI** – You can’t mess it up. We tried.
- 🖱️ **Right-click disables fields** – Control freaks rejoice.
- ⚡ **Fast Setup** – Because life’s too short for config hell.
- 🔄 **Import/Export Word Lists** – JSON for the brave.
- 🔧 **Multiple Field Types** – Because one size never fits all.

## 🧠 Backend Options

JustBingo supports two backend modes. One is fine. The other is *better*.

### ✅ Recommended: PocketBase

PocketBase support turns JustBingo into a real boy—complete with a web admin interface, user accounts, and proper authentication.

### ☠️ Legacy: Node.js

Still there for the nostalgia-driven or masochists among us.

## 📦 Self-Hosting, Setup & Configuration

We could write a novel here. But we didn’t. Instead, go to the [JustBingo Wiki](https://github.com/spj2401Dev/JustBingo/wiki) where it’s all lovingly documented.

That includes:

- How to set up with **PocketBase** (yes, it’s better)
- How to configure the frontend
- All the gory details of user auth
- Deployment notes and more

You’re welcome.
