1. **Simple and Straightforward Design**: User-friendly interface for an enjoyable experience.
2. **Right Click to Disable a Field**: Easily manage your bingo fields with a simple right-click.
3. **Fast and Configurable**: Quick setup and configuration to suit your needs.
4. **Import and Export Word Lists as JSON**: Seamlessly manage your bingo words.
5. **Multiple Field Types**: Flexibility to create various types of fields.
6. **Perfect for Every Daily Standup**: Make your daily meetings more engaging and fun!

## Usage
When you first load up the page, there will be nothing. You need to navigate to "/admin". There you will be first of all prompted to login. The default logins are `admin' and 'password`.
On there you can add your words. You need at least 25 (5x5) to not have any empty fields.
After that you can just navigate back to the "/" page and you will be served your bingo grid in a random order :D
Have fun!

## Self-hosting

### Natively

1. **Setup Environment**: Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and configure the IP, Port, and Admin login credentials as needed.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all necessary npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Application**: Launch the app with:
   ```bash
   npm start

### In Docker

Alternatively you can run the application in Docker. To do so, first build the container:
```
docker build -t justbingo:latest .
```

Then run the container:
```
docker run --init --name justbingo -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=hunter2 justbingo:latest
```
By default the application will bind to any interface in the container, which
should be suitable for most deployment scenarios and allows to directly expose
it on a port of the host machine.

You can customize aspects of the application by overriding the set of
environment variables which are listend in the `.env.template` file, as shown
above with the admin password.

To automatically load the set of configured bingo tiles, you can mount a
`words.json` file, as generated by the application's "export JSON" function, to
`/usr/src/app/words.json` in the container.

## Developing

1. **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file is optional. The app defaults to `localhost:3000`, with the default admin login as `admin` and password as `password`.
2. **Install Packages**: Install required packages using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Application**: Start the app using:
   ```bash
   node .
   ```
